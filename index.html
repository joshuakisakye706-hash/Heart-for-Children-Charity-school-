      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Heart for Children Charity School was founded in <strong>2025</strong> with one dream:
        to give every child—no matter their background—a safe place to learn, grow, and build a bright future.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started with a small group of volunteers teaching under wooden building using donated books.
        Today, we serve hundreds of children with love, care, and quality education.
